# In Vitro Tomogram Analysis
This directory contains scripts used to process cryo-electron micrographs and reconstructed maps of F-actin subjected to myosin motor forces in the absence or presence of sub-saturating alpha-catenin conditions.

The scripts used to train neural networks for and run denoising and segmentation on the micrographs may be found in "particle_picking". The file paths were modified to accomodate each collected dataset.
The scripts used to analyze single particle reconstructions of deformed F-actin may be found in "actin_analysis".
The scripts used to analyze single particle reconstructions of deformed F-actin in the presence of alpha-catenin may be found in "acat_analysis".
The scripts used to generate bild files of protomer deformations may be found in "arrow_bilds".
