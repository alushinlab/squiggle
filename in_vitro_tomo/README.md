# In Vitro Tomogram Analysis
This directory contains scripts used to process cryo-electron tomograms of F-actin subjected to myosin motor forces.

The scripts used to train neural networks for and run denoising on the tomograms may be found in "denoising".
The scripts used to subsequently process these denoised tomograms may be found in "analysis".
