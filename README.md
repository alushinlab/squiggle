# Squiggle
This repository is a collection of scripts used in the project "Myosin forces elicit an F-actin structural landscape that modulates mechanosensitive protein recognition," which has been pre-printed on bioRXiv here: https://www.biorxiv.org/???

The scripts used to process cryo-EM and cryo-ET data of F-actin subjected to myosin motor activity may be found in "in_vitro_tomo" and "single_particle". These scripts were developed by Matthew Reynolds with assistance from Ayala Carl.
The scripts used to process cryo-CLEM data from cells may be found in "clem". These scripts were developed by Donovan Phua and Keith Hamilton.
The scripts used in coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of these systems may be found in "simulations". These scripts were developed by Xiaoyu Sun.
